-If you&rsquo;re looking for something more drawn out, try checking out OVA&rsquo;s or one-shots before getting into the full series. These episodes usually have less action and more atmosphere, which can add to your enjoyment while giving you more closure on the story.</p><h2 id=dry-brushing-technique-for-oil-portrait-painting---youtube>Dry Brushing Technique For Oil Portrait Painting - YouTube<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#dry-brushing-technique-for-oil-portrait-painting---youtube>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pNqBBi4fDaw/maxresdefault.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W9m06g5T89Nl7NKeVTWLfgHaEK&pid=15.1"' alt="Dry brushing technique for oil portrait painting - YouTube"><p><em>Source: youtube.com</em></p><blockquote><p>technique dry oil painting.</p></blockquote><p>Conclusion
